Open Cordova Project in Existing Folder
=======================================

The purpose of this tool is to make it easier to Open any existing Cordova Project from a given folder from the command line.

Ideal to edit in VS after using any scaffoling tool.

VS allow you to do that from the UI, via File ->New -> Project From Existing Folder
This tool will do almost the same, using the name of the folder as the name of the .jsproj file.

## Changes to default behavior
